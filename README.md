## Tiles
Tiles is a markdown editor which is made in Java. It is currently not in a functional state. This is also my first large Java project and therefore may not include the highest quality code (but it will be improving over time).

###libraries
For the conversion of md files to html I have used markdown4j. More information on it can be found here: https://code.google.com/archive/p/markdown4j/

Currently there is a interface but any input will not be converted (this is the current section I am working on)
