## Tiles
Tiles is a markdown editor which is made in Java. It is currently not in a functional state. This is also my first large Java project and therefore may not include the highest quality code (but it will be improving over time). 

### run the program
To run the application clone this repo and compile Tiles.java. After compiling, running Tiles.java will launch the application.
