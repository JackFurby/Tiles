## Tiles
Tiles is a markdown editor which is made in Java. It is currently not in a functional state. This is also my first large Java project and therefore may not include the highest quality code (but it will be improving over time).

### Libraries
For the conversion of md files to html I have used commonmark-java. More information can be found here: https://github.com/atlassian/commonmark-java

### Current development
Currently there is a interface and input is converted to html before being rendered. A few buttons in the menu work.

### To do
* Improve cut, copy and paste
* Help menu
* CSS for application (add as application is developed)
* CSS for output (WIP)
* Preferences / settings
* Config (WIP)
* Syntax highlighting (JavaFX code area?)
* Spell check (JavaFX code area?)
* Fix toggle maximise button
* File menu
    * Open recent
    * Export
        * PDF
    * Print
