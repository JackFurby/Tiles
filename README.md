## Tiles
Tiles is a markdown editor which is made in Java. It is currently not in a functional state. This is also my first large Java project and therefore may not include the highest quality code (but it will be improving over time).

### libraries
For the conversion of md files to html I have used commonmark-java. More information can be found here: https://github.com/atlassian/commonmark-java

Currently there is a interface and input will be converted and rendered as html. Still a lot of work to complete until the program is functional
