## Tiles
Tiles is a markdown editor which is made in Java. It is currently not in a functional state. This is also my first large Java project and therefore may not include the highest quality code (but it will be improving over time).

### Libraries
For the conversion of md files to html I have used commonmark-java. More information can be found here: https://github.com/atlassian/commonmark-java

### Current development
Currently there is a interface and input is converted to html before being rendered. A few buttons in the menu work.

### To do
